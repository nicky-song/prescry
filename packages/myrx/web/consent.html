    <h1>PRESCRYPTIVE HEALTH</h1>
    <h2>INFORMED CONSENT, AUTHORIZATION AND RELEASE OF CLAIMS</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      I hereby acknowledge that I have registered with Prescryptive Health, 
      Inc. ("Prescryptive") for purposes of: (1) scheduling an appointment 
      for receiving Third-party Services at a pharmacy, clinic, hospital, 
      physician office or any other authorized location ("Third-Party Service 
      Location") via Prescryptive's online booking system; and (2) receiving 
      information regarding my Third-Party Services on Prescryptive's online 
      booking system.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
      As used herein, the term "Third-Party Services" means the healthcare 
      services that I am able to schedule at a Third-Party Service Location 
      upon registering with Prescryptive Health. I understand and agree that: 
      (1) such healthcare services will be limited to those services that are 
      within the Third-Party Service Location's scope of practice based on 
      their credentials and jurisdiction; and (2) that Prescryptive may, in 
      its sole discretion, add or remove certain health services from its list 
      of services that I am able to schedule via Prescryptive's on-line booking 
      system. 
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Consent Form</h3>
    <p>
      I understand that I will be required to complete and sign a Consent Form 
      at the time of my appointment for each Third-Party Service that I schedule 
      via Prescryptive's online booking system. I hereby represent that I will 
      complete and execute the Consent Form either prior to or upon arrival at 
      the Third-Party Service Location. I understand that I will not be allowed 
      to receive the Third-Party Service until I complete and sign the Consent Form.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that I make an appointment for a Third-Party Service for someone 
      other than myself, I will advise that person of the need to complete and 
      execute the Consent Form prior to receiving the Third-Party Service.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Authorization to Disclose My Test Records</h3>
    <p>
      I hereby acknowledge that, when registering with Prescryptive, I accepted 
      Prescryptive's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy and, in doing so, I 
      appointed Prescryptive as my authorized representative to: (1) obtain from 
      my healthcare providers my medical records, including Protected Health 
      Information ("PHI") subject to the Health Insurance Portability and 
      Accountability Act ("HIPAA"); and (2) to disclose and use that information 
      only for the purpose of providing the services that I have requested and in 
      accordance with my instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuant to, and consistent with my appointment of Prescryptive as my authorized 
      representative, I hereby authorize Prescryptive, the Third-Party Service Location 
      and my other healthcare providers to disclose the following information to each 
      other and to any public health authority in accordance with applicable laws, 
      regulations and guidance: (1) my answers to any required pre-Third-Party Service 
      questionnaire; (2) the specifics regarding the Third-Party Service I receive and 
      the date(s) I received the Third-Party Service; and (3) any other medical records 
      created during the delivery and reporting of my Third-Party Services. The purpose 
      of these authorized disclosures is to facilitate the tracking and recording of my 
      Third-Party Services and to comply with all applicable authorities regarding the 
      delivery and reporting of Third-Party Services. Given the evolving science 
      regarding the Third-Party Services that I may receive, I acknowledge and agree 
      that this authorization does not expire, subject to my right to revoke my 
      authorization as stated below.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that I have the right to refuse to accept this agreement and that, 
      if I do accept, I have the right to revoke this authorization to disclose my 
      medical records in a writing addressed to Prescryptive at support@prescryptive.com. 
      I understand that any action already taken in reliance on my authorization, as 
      set forth herein, cannot be reversed, and my revocation will not affect those 
      actions that took place prior to Prescryptive's receipt of my written revocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that there is the potential that any PHI that is used or disclosed 
      pursuant to my authorization may be subject to re-disclosure by the persons(s) 
      or facilities receiving that information and would then no longer be protected 
      under HIPAA.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Release of Claims</h3>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by Law, I hereby release, discharge and hold 
      harmless Prescryptive, the Third-Party Service Location and my other healthcare 
      providers involved in the delivery and reporting of the my Third-Party Services, 
      including, without limitation, any of their respective officers, directors, 
      employees, representatives and agents, from any and all claims, liability, and 
      damages, of whatever kind or nature, arising out of or in connection with any 
      act or omission relating to my Third-Party Services or the disclosure of my 
      Third-Party Services records.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Authorized Representative Attestation</h3>
    <p>
      In the event that I register with Prescryptive and schedule a Third-Party 
      Service on behalf of a person other than myself, I hereby represent and state 
      that I am the parent, guardian or other representative authorized under 
      applicable law to accept this Informed Consent, Authorization and Release of 
      Claims on behalf of that person and to bind that person to each term set forth 
      herein.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
    <p>
      I carefully have read this Consent, Authorization and Release of Claims and 
      I fully understand its contents. I acknowledge that my acceptance of this
